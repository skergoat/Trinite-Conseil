"<p>Debugging why testimonial submissions don't work are tricky. There's at least 9 of the following reasons to work through.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<ul>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>The testimonials submission page is cached</li>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>Akismet – Comment spam</li>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>BBCode is Spam – Review the testimonial contents for BBCode links</li>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>Validate Submission IP – Validity check for used IP address</li>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>Use Anti-spam Regular Expressions – Predefined and custom patterns by plugin hook</li>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>Check Local Spam Database – Already marked as spam? Yes? No?</li>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>Check Public Anti-spam Database – Matching the IP address with Tornevall</li>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>Block Testimonials From Specific Countries – Filtering the requests depending on country</li>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>Allow Testimonials Only In Certain Language – Detection and approval in specified language</li>\n"
"\t\t\t</ul>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>The quick fixes for testimonial submissions not working are caching and location related. Try these first.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<ol>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>Make sure that the testimonials submission page isn't cached</li>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>Deactivate the \"Validate Submission IP\", \"Check Public Anti-spam Database\", and \"Block Testimonials From Specific Countries\" tests one at a time and test testimonial form submissions again.</li>\n"

"\t\t\t<p>If you're still having trouble, then you'll need to invoke <code>testmode</code>.</p>\n"
